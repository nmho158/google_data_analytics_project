## Introduction

This is the final project for the Google Professional Certificate Data Analytics . The certification equips aspiring data analysts with the knowledge and skills required to obtain insights from data. I am resolving this case study by employing all six phases of the analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. 

## Scenario 

Cyclistic is a bike-sharing program in Chicago comprised of more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic distinguishes itself by offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more accessible to individuals with disabilities and riders unable to ride conventional two-wheeled bicycles. The marketing strategy of Cyclistic relied on building brand awareness and appealing to diverse consumer segments. The flexibility of its pricing plans—single-ride passes, all-day passes, and annual membership—has been instrumental in making this possible. Casual riders are customers who buy single-ride tickets or all-day passes.

The Cyclistic finance analysts believe that it is more profitable to maximize the number of annual membership subscribers. Instead of creating additional marketing campaigns to attract customers, Moreno, the director of the marketing team, considers it would be advantageous for Cyclistic to convert casual riders into annual members. Moreno's objective is straight-forward: to develop marketing strategies that convert casual riders into annual members. To accomplish this, the marketing analyst team must gain a deeper understanding of the differences between annual members and casual riders, the reasons why casual riders would purchase a membership, and how digital media could impact their marketing strategies.

I am assuming a position as a junior data analyst for the marketing team and am participating in order to handle this issue. This is also my opportunity to demonstrate my data analysis skills. 

## Data Analysis Phases 
### Ask

This is the initial phase of data analysis, which involves defining the problem while acquiring a comprehensive understanding of stakeholder expectations. The primary **business task** would be to devise marketing strategies to convert casual riders to annual members. 

Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

I am responsible for responding to the first question above. In my case, I will divide the first question into two smaller parts so that my thought process is easily followed by the team:  What are the differences between casual riders and membership riders, and why are these distinctions present?
